# Welcome to My Christmas Tree
Welcome to My Printf projeckt. 

Here I will try to explain basics of the program and how to make it work.

## Task
The task for the this assignment was to create a function that prints a Christmas Tree in given dimentions.

It needs to have special features and I think that is the challening part.

## Description
To be able to solve this problem I used individual print statements for different parts.

MyChristmasTree function receives the size it wants to print and according to the dimentions prints the desired dimentions of the tree.

## Installation
You can find the project on GitHub and after accessinng it use make command in the terminal to make the program work.

Makefile has been flagged with -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror which is enough for this program.

After calling make in terminal just write ./my_christmas_tree <size></size> and you will execute the program.

## Usage
After accessinng the files you need to use a terminal to execute Makefile by command "make".

The program should compile and ready to use.
```
./my_christmas_tree <size></size>
./my_christmas_tree 1
./my_christmas_tree 2
./my_christmas_tree 5
```
